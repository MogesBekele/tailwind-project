This project is a responsive web application designed and built using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It focuses on providing a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface while ensuring excellent performance across devices. By leveraging Tailwindâ€™s powerful utilities, I was able to create reusable, customizable components with minimal custom CSS, resulting in faster development and improved maintainability.
